# OAT v1.3.0 Documentation
## Changes
* Added a lot more functions
* Changed comments so that you have to space comments from the code
## Variables
`dec var_name var_value` - auto declares a variable  
`sdec` - declares a string, a must for concatenation  
`idec` - declares an integer  
`cdec` - declares a char  
`fdec` - declares a float  
`ddec` - declares a double  
`bdec` - declares a boolean  
`mov a b` - copies the value of a into b  
`def temp_var_name` - creates a temp value so that functions that use two arguments can send to a variable, like pow  
`rdef used_var` - moves an already initialized variable into DEF  
`conv 76 double` - converts a into b and places it into DEF. Uses static_cast<type>(x)  
`iconv a b` - converts a into an inter and then stores it in b. works on strings  
`fconv a b` - converts a into a float and then places it in b. works on strings  
`dconv a b` - converts a into a double and then places it in b. works on strings  

## Math
`cat a b` - adds two strings together. converts b into a string  
`add a b` - adds a and b and stores it in a  
`sub a b` - subtracts b from a and stores it in a  
`mul a b` - multiplies a and b and stores it in a  
`div a b` - divides a and b and stores it in a  
`mod a b` - gets the modulus of a and b and stores it in a  
`pow a b` - gets the power of a and b and stores them in DEF or a custom def  
`rpow a b` - recursive power. calculates a^b, then stores it back into a  
`ipow a b` - same as before, but more accurate  
`fpow a b` - more accurate powers for floats  
`dpow a b` - more accurate powers for doubles  
`round a b` - rounds a, and puts it into new variable b  
`defadd` - adds a and b then stores it in DEF  
`defsub` - subtracts b from a then stores it in DEF  
`defmul` - multiplies a and b then stores it in DEF  
`defdiv` - divides a and b then stores it in DEF  
`defmod` - modulus of a and b is stored in DEF  
`defpow` - gets a^b then stores it in DEF  

## Input/Output
`io out a` - prints out a to the console  
`io nlout a` - prints out a to the console with a newline appended  
`io in name` - declares name as a string, then gets the input and stores it in name  
`io defin` - gets input, then stores it in DEF  
`io input message_var` - displays the message in message_var, then stores input in DEF  

## Conditional statements
### Assert
`asserteq a b` - prints a == b to console. e.g. true or false
`assertlt a b` - asserts if a < b  
`assertgt a b` - asserts if a > b  
`assertgteq a b` - asserts if a >= b  
`assertlteq a b` - asserts if a <= b  
  
`fasserteq a b` - formatted print a == b to console. e.g. a == b = false
`fassertlt a b` - format asserts if a < b  
`fassertgt a b` - format asserts if a > b  
`fassertgteq a b` - format asserts if a >= b  
`fassertlteq a b` - format asserts if a <= b  

## Miscellaneous
`cpp` - anything after here is C++ code. e.g. `cpp std::cout << “Hello World!\n”;`  
`include` - includes libraries that certain functions use, so that you just include these, then use C++ code.  
**Include libraries:**
* `io` - for std::cout, etc
* `string` - for string operations
* `conv` - for conversions
* `math` - for pow(), etc
* `type` - for checking the type

## Special Characters
### Predefined variables
`NEWLINE` - \n - The newline character  
`SPACE` - “ “ - a space  
`TRUE` - true  
`FALSE` - false  

### Comments
Comments start with a semicolon: “`;`”. Anything after the “`;`” will be ignored.  
After v1.2.0, you can now add comments after code.  
After v1.3.0 comments must be have at least 1 space after code.
