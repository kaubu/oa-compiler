# OAT v1.2.0 Documentation
## Changes
* You can now add comments after code instead of on its own line
* You can now have spaces in strings
## Variables
`dec var_name var_value` - auto declares a variable  
`strdec` - declares a string, a must for concatenation  
`intdec` - declares an integer  
`chardec` - declares a char  
`floatdec` - declares a float  
`doubledec` - declares a double  
`booldec` - declares a boolean  
`mov a b` - copies the value of a into b  
`def temp_var_name` - creates a temp value so that functions that use two arguments can send to a variable, like pow  
`conv 76 double` - converts a into b and places it into DEF. Uses static_cast<type>(x)  
`fconv a b` - converts a into a float and then places it in b. works on strings  
`dconv a b` - converts a into a double and then places it in b. works on strings  

## Math
`cat a b` - adds two strings together. converts b into a string  
`add a b` - adds a and b and stores it in a  
`sub a b` - subtracts b from a and stores it in a  
`mul a b` - multiplies a and b and stores it in a  
`div a b` - divides a and b and stores it in a  
`mod a b` - gets the modulus of a and b and stores it in a  
`pow a b` - gets the power of a and b and stores them in DEF or a custom def  
`ipow a b` - same as before, but more accurate  
`fpow a b` - more accurate powers for floats  
`dpow a b` - more accurate powers for doubles  
`round a b` - rounds a, and puts it into new variable b  

## Input/Output
`io out a` - prints out a to the console  
`io nlout a` - prints out a to the console with a newline appended  
`io in name` - declares name as a string, then gets the input and stores it in name  

## Special Characters
### Predefined variables
`NEWLINE` - \n - The newline character  
`SPACE` - “ “ - a space  
`TRUE` - true  
`FALSE` - false  

### Comments
Comments start with a semicolon: “`;`”. Anything after the “`;`” will be ignored.  
After v1.2.0, you can now add comments after code.
